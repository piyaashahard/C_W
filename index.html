              The atmosphere of Earth, commonly known as air, is the layer of
              gases retained by Earth's gravity that surrounds the planet and
              forms its planetary atmosphere. The atmosphere of Earth protects
              life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to
              exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar
              radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse
              effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night
              (the diurnal temperature variation).

              The atmosphere is held on the earth by the gravitational pull of
              the earth. A column of air exerts weight in terms of pressure on
              the surface of the earth. The weight of the column of air at a
              given place and time is called air pressure or atmospheric
              pressure. Atmospheric pressure is measured by an instrument called
              barometer. The units used by meteorologists for this purpose are
              called millibars (mb). One millibar is equal to the force of one
              gram on a square centimeter. The normal pressure at sea level is
              taken to be about 76 centimeters of mercury column height (1013.25
              millibars).

              Cloud is a visible mass of minute liquid droplets, frozen
              crystals, or other particles suspended in the atmosphere. Clouds
              are formed when air contains as much water vapor (gas) as it can
              hold. This is called the saturation point, and it can be reached
              in two ways. First, moisture accumulates until it reaches the
              maximum amount the volume of air can hold. The other method
              reduces the temperature of the moisture filled air, which in turn
              lowers the amount of moisture it can contain. Saturation,
              therefore, is reached through evaporation and condensation,
              respectively. When saturation occurs, moisture becomes visible
              water droplets in the form of fog and clouds.
